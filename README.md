# Surf Time - Your Digital Time Tracker

This tiny browser extension was born out of an inside joke - to prove to my friend that I dont live inside my laptop! It automatically tracks your browsing time across different websites, visualizes your digital habits, and provides fun insights powered by AI.

Want to know if you're really spending "just 5 minutes" on YouTube? Or if those quick social media checks are actually turning into hour-long sessions? Surf Time's got you covered! It silently runs in the background, collecting your browsing patterns locally (no data ever leaves your device), and presents them in beautiful, easy-to-understand charts.

What makes this different? It's not here to make you feel guilty about your screen time - instead, it turns your browsing data into a fun "surf report", complete with wave analogies and light-hearted insights. Whether you're diving deep into work or just catching some casual waves on the internet, Surf Time helps you understand your digital flow without the judgment.
